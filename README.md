## OASIS TC Open Repository: tac-ontology

This GitHub public repository [tac-ontology](https://github.com/oasis-open/tac-ontology/) was created at the request of the [OASIS Threat Actor Context (TAC) TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tac/) as an [OASIS TC Open Repository](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/) to support development of open source resources related to Technical Committee work.
